- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexJPaton
- 👀 I’m interested in invasive species management and wildlife monitoring technology. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning occupancy and secr modelling . 
- 💞️ I’m looking to share some of the data wrangling code I have been working with camelot exports. It is not the best code you will ever run, but it will run.
